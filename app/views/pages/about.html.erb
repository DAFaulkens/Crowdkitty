    <h3><%=image_tag('/assets/icons/kitty.jpg', alt: "Home", width:30) %> Why do we do it?</h3>
    <p id="paragraph_indent">Great ideas are hard to make happen. Wanting to help but not being able to is a frustrating feeling. For the second project on our course, we were handed a brief to create a project funding site. But through collaboration, hard work and dedication it evolved into much more. We wanted to create something that would have a real purpose, that would benefit the community and help people. Out of this came CrowdKitty.
